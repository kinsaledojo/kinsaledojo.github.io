CoderDojo is a free computer club for kids, which started in Cork in 2011 and grew quickly into a global community of over 1000 clubs operating in 65 countries. Starting 2012, CoderDojo Kinsale has brought the global good vibes to young coders in the Kinsale area and beyond. We work within communities to provide free computer workshops in fun learning environments â€“ breaking down barriers, challenging social and economic stereotypes, and empowering youth to shape their world through code.
