CoderDojo participants can receive badges as a recognition of their developing skills or their participation in the CoderDojo community. Examples include badges for JavaScript programming, for attending ten Dojos, or for being a Mentor.

Badges are awarded by Dojo Champions, for most things, or by the CoderDojo Foundation in the case of events like Coolest Projects.
