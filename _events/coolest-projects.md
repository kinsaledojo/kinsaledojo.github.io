Coolest Projects is a world-leading showcase for young innovators who make stuff with technology. It’s open to everyone up to the age of 18 who likes to make something with technology for fun, to solve a problem, or just to be create something interesting. Coolest Projects is a great opportunity for young people to get creative, have fun, learn from others, and be a part of something truly special. Your creation could be an animation, website, game, app, robot, or anything else you’ve built with technology.

Creators at all levels of experience are encouraged, with projects from beginner to advanced, and it doesn’t matter whether your project is a work in progress, a prototype, or a finished product — every participant and every project is welcome! Ninjas at Coderdojo Kinsale participate in Coolest Projects every year. In recent years we have submitted many wonderful projects and have had some amazing successes.
